### Top 10 hacks to be a BAD developer

1. Code first, design later. <br> <br>
2. If people can't understand your code, they are not smart enough <br> <br>
3. Never write unit tests and when you are forced to write them, write short and easy ones <br> <br>
4. The only job of test coverage is to please engineering managers <br> <br>
5. Take all suggestions in code reviews personally <br> <br>
6. Always avoid documentation. Only work on it long after your project is complete. <br> <br>
7. Logging, Metrics & Alerts are just there to add more story points. Your code is always reliable. <br> <br>
8. Just get things to work once and push them to production quickly. Never actively monitor your changes in production. <br> <br>
9. Don't read software documentation, only rely on internet blogs <br> <br>
10. Never think about the end user, you are an engineer not a product freak <br> <br>

Of course, above is meant for what you should not do at you job. <br><br>
