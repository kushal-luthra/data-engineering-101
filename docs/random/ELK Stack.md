## What is ELK Stack and why is it so popular for log management?

The ELK Stack is composed of three open-source products. <br>

ELK stands for **Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.**  <br>

ðŸ”¹ Elasticsearch is a full-text search and analysis engine, leveraging Apache Lucene search engine as its core component. <br>

ðŸ”¹ Logstash collects data from all kinds of edge collectors, then transforms that data and sends it to various destinations for further processing or visualization. <br>

In order to scale the edge data ingestion, a new product Beats is later developed as lightweight agents installed on edge hosts to collect and ship logs to Logstash. <br>

ðŸ”¹ Kibana is a visualization layer with which users analyze and visualize the data. <br>

The diagram below shows how ELK Stack works: <br>

Step 1 - Beats collects data from various data sources. For example, Filebeat and Winlogbeat work with logs, and Packetbeat works with network traffic. <br>

Step 2 - Beats sends data to Logstash for aggregation and transformation. If we work with massive data, we can add a message queue (Kafka) to decouple the data producers and consumers. <br>

Step 3 - Logstash writes data into Elasticsearch for data indexing and storage. <br>

Step 4 - Kibana builds on top of Elasticsearch and provides users with various search tools and dashboards with which to visualize the data. <br>

ELK Stack is pretty convenient for troubleshooting and monitoring. It became popular by providing a simple and robust suite in the log analytics space, for a reasonable price. <br>
