#### Leaders are right, a lot
Such people who are right a lot are hvaing following characteristics-> <br>
a. they listen a lot. <br>
 <br>
b. they change their mind a lot. <br>
Why -> <br>
Life is complicated rules are complicated and so when you get more data, you change your mind. <br>
Sometimes you don't get data but just re-analyze a situation and change your mind. <br>
Anybody who doesn't change mind a lot underestimates the complexity of world we live in. <br>

c. they seek to disconfirm their most profoundly held convictions. <br>


#### Frugality
Having small team size makes sense - so that essence of human organization - team work and cohesion comes up. <br>
If team size is large, leader should make more sub-leaders so that communication and performance can be effective. <br>


#### Hire smart people
No single individual person can keep in touch with plethora of new things that are happening. <br>
So you need a recruitment process to hire and retain smart talented hard-working people who want to be part of your mission. <br>

**What is Amazon's Mission : be the world's most customer-centric company** <br>
Its a goal larger than Amazon. <br>
This involves 3 things -> listen, invent, personalize. <br>
- Companies that don't listen to customer cannot survive. <br>
- Companies that only listen to customer fail. They need to invent and find novice solutions to customer's problems. <br>
    It is not customer job to invent, it is company's job and if they fail to do so, they cannot survive. <br>
- See each and every customer as centre of their own universe ~ personalize. <br>

#### On work=life balance.
We should use then term **work-life harmony**. <br>
If you are happy at work, you come home as a better husband, father and person. <br>
And if you have harmony at home, you come to office as better employee. <br>
Organizations must strive to ensure harmony at workspace. <br>

#### Learn & be curious, bias for actions
For most people harmony at work means finding work which is meaningful, interesting and impactful. <br>
Because of kind of challenges we have chosen for ourselves, we get to work for future and its super fun to work for the future. <br>
We work in environment where there is constant change. This is how high-tech domain is. <br>
If one doesnt enjoy this environment, they wont be able to sustain in long term. <br>

We need to build people, and it is human nature to focus on things that aren't working, and its incredibly hard to get people to take bold bets. <br>
That is something we need to  encourage because bets are prone to failure, but those that succeed, they can compensate for dozens of things that didn't work. <br>
At amazon, it took some bold bets that worked out really well- Kindle, AWS, Prime, etc. <br>

Companies that don't embrace failure, they eventually get into position of desperation. <br>

####  Have backbone , disagree and commit | dive deep ; be skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ
Generally assumed that companies need to eventually raise prices in order to increase profit margins. <br>
Amazon wants to lower price further because it sees things in terms of scale.  <br>
Unlike physical stores wherein good service and low prices both aren't available, online stores can have both best service and lowest prices. <br>
Need to increase profit not in terms of % margins but in terms of dollar margins, i.e. sell more product - when you lower price, you attract more people and more sales - so more profit. <br>
