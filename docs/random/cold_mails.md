# Cold Mails Tactics

🟢 Run the triple: Start every sequence with an email, social touch, and cold call.

🟢 5x5x5: 5 minutes of research. Find 5 insights on the person/account. Write your message in 5 minutes.

🟢 Subject lines shouldn’t read like an advertisement. They should be 4 words max, not a complete sentence, and without punctuation. 

🟢 Don't equate formality with professionalism. You don't need to address me as "Dear Mr. Farrokh"). Use conjunctions and conversational language

🟢 Follow the 3x3 Rule for email: 3 paragraphs, no more than 3 lines each when read on your phone. 

🟢 Don't try to sell everything under the sun in your email. One pain point per email, or you risk losing them. Mix in multiple pain points across the sequence.

🟢 Avoid large images, multiple hyperlinks, and big attachments. These add-ons scream "marketing email" and hurt deliverability.

🟢 Use Interest-based CTAs. "Open to learning more?" is better than “How's Thursday at 4:00 for a discovery call?”

🟢 Your emails should read like text messages. If you read it out loud and sound like a robot, you’re doing it wrong.

🟢 Tie VMs to emails: Leave voicemails that reference your emails and vice-versa. Even if they never get answered, voicemails should boost email replies.
