## Introduction to Machine Learning

As we already know, artificial intelligence has evolved considerably over the last few years. <br>
It started with the field of artificial intelligence in which the first more rudimentary artificial intelligence models were developed. <br>
It was between the 1950s-1980s, the field of machine learning emerged. <br>
That's when supervised and unsupervised learning machine learning models are developed. <br>
In addition, throughout these years is when machine learning gained strength and began to be applied. <br>
 <br>
Finally, deep learning was developed in 2010. <br>
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that trains a computer to perform tasks as humans do. <br>
These tasks include speech recognition, image identification or video analysis. <br>
 <br>
At this time, machine learning was booming and applied in different fields. <br>
However, during all these years, some challenges have persisted. <br>
 <br>

 <br>
According to a survey by algorithmic, 85% of models fail to deploy to production. <br>
- 55% of companies have never implemented a machine learning model. <br>
- These problems have caused 85% of machine learning projects to fail. <br>
 <br>
Some main reasons are the lack of talent, the lack of processes that can manage change, and the absence of automated systems. <br>
It is well known that there is a shortage of people trained in this field. <br>
A single data scientist can take a few weeks to develop a model. <br>
However, putting the same model into production can take months of work for a team of developers. <br>
Why? Because model must be scalable, reproducible and collaborative to be deployed in production. <br>
 <br>
You have to package the developments, establish the dependencies between the libraries, add parameters, execute scripts, and automate this process. <br>
It is also necessary to scale it so that it can meet the demands of users.  <br>
To do this, you must add a load balancer, partition the data and adjust different model configurations. <br>
 <br>
You also have to parallelize the model's training to support CPU, especially when we want to train the model with large amounts of data. <br>
 <br>
Finally, you have to monitor the results and make a record. <br> 
 <br>
Thanks to this, we ensure that our model continues to work correctly over time. <br>
It is also necessary to generate different versions of the model. <br>
 <br>
Finally, you have to automate the process. <br>
You have to create workflows and make it possible to update the models and many other transformations. <br>
 <br>
How is all this done? <br>
Thanks to the MLOps and new trend has appeared in recent years. <br>

Here's Gartner's Trend Graph. <br>
This graph analyzes all the trends that have appeared related to the field of data. <br>
If we look closely at this curve, we can identify the trend of MLOps. <br>
 <br>
MLOps was born to streamline the process of putting our machine learning models into production. <br>
