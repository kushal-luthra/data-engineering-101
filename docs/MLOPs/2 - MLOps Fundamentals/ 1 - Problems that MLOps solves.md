## Challenges addressed by MLOps

#### Versioning
The tools and techniques defined in MLOps make data scientists work easier. <br>
On the one hand, it addresses the issue of versioning. <br>
Version control is common in software engineering with tools like GitHub or Git. <br>
In addition to code control, you must control other things like model data and artifacts. <br>
Model and data versioning ensures that experiments are reproducible, and we can replicate the same results across different iterations. <br>
 <br>

#### Model Tracking
Another problem it solves is the monitoring of the performance of the model models, and production can degrade over time. <br>
It is due to the differences between training data and test data. <br>
It is known as Data Drift. <br>
If we monitor the performance of a model, we can identify and solve those problems. <br>
 <br>

#### Feature Generation / Feature Engineering
Finally, the last problem that ML solves is that of feature engineering. <br>
Feature engineering can be a time-consuming task and computing resources. <br>
The MLOps application allows functions to be generated only once and can be used as many times as needed. <br>
It frees up the data scientists to focus on designing and testing the model. <br>
